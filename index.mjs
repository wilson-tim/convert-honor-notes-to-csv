Steps to get/export your notes from Huawei Notes:

1. Login into a Huawei Account in the phone.
2. Activate in your phone, the Notes Syncing, which is inside of Huawei Account > Cloud
3. Log in into https://cloud.huawei.com
4. Go to https://cloud.huawei.com/home#/account/gdpr, and click on Download Notes
5. This will give you a zip file with a password. Extract the zip file into a folder.
6. Copy this file into the folder as index.mjs
7. You'll need NodeJs installed for this: https://nodejs.org/en/
   I made and tested this on v18+, but v19 and v16 should also work
8. open a console/terminal (see how to do that in your OS), and run in it "node index.mjs"
9. Your notes should be in the notes.txt file inside of the same folder.

Extra:
The script only copies the text content, as simple text,
and it doesn't copy the title or other stuff that your notes might contain.
I left a comment in the portion of code that might be helpful to modify if
you want more information, such as the creation time, or other info.
